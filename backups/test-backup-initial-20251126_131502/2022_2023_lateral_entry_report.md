2. **Scheme Revival Attempt:** The government attempted to revive the scheme in 2024 with a much larger scale (45 positions), but faced immediate political resistance and had to withdraw.

3. **Pattern of Controversy:** Both the 2018 batch and 2024 attempt faced criticism over reservation policy and transparency, suggesting systemic challenges with the scheme's design.

4. **Limited Success:** Out of 5 years examined (2018-2024 period), only 2 years saw actual appointments (2018 batch finalized in 2019, and one 2021 appointment).

### Current Status (as of 2024):
- The scheme remains controversial
- No active lateral entry appointments in government
- Future of the program uncertain pending policy decisions on reservation and selection transparency
